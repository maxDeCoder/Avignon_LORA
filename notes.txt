- Expected Packet loss of 10%

# Run 1

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 10s

# Run 2

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 8s

# Run 3

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 6s

# Run 4

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 4s

# Run 5

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 2s

# Run 6

sent payload = "Test_Message_<delay>_<id>"
num_packets = 100
interpacket delay = 1s

- As interpacket delay increases, the time to receive later packets increases

- Size of packet
- Periodicity
- Why not batch of data
